# {{ page.title }}

This page identifies the versions of Adobe Experience Manager with which a particular version of ACS AEM Commons is compatible. In general, we strive to be compatible with the current version and the last prior version. For the purpose of this page, _compatible_ means that the package is install-able. Individual features may require a higher version. Please refer to the individual feature documentation pages for more details.

## AEM as a Cloud Service Feature Incompatibility

ACS AEM Commons 5.0.0 and greater can be deployed to AEM as a Cloud Service. While the ACS AEM Commons package itself is deployable to AEM as a Cloud service, this does NOT mean that all features work or should be used on AEM as a Cloud Service.
The table below calls out the known problematic features categorizing them by "Incompatibility Level"

* __INCOMPATIBLE__ indicates the features that should not, and may not be possible to use in AEM as a Cloud Service. This classification is broken into two sub-classifications:
    + __MISSING DEPENDENCY__: Features that depend on API or integrations that do not exist in AEM as a Cloud Service, and thus cannot work on AEM as a Cloud Service. 
    * __ANTI-PATTERN__: Features that are implemented using an anti-pattern in AEM as a Cloud Service.
* __WARN__: While not technically incompatible, this ACS AEM Commons feature is often used to perform work that is an __ANTI-PATTERN__ (for example, using Bulk Workflow Manager to generate renditions for assets using AEM Workflow Processes, instead of Assets microservices).
* __REPLACED__: AEM as a Cloud Service now provides a better version of this feature that more closely aligns w/ the overall AEM as a Cloud Service infrastructure.

All features classified as __INCOMPATIBLE (MISSING DEPENDENCY)__, __INCOMPATIBLE (ANTI-PATTERN)__, and __REPLACED__ have (or will have) an internal kill-switch in the in ACS AEM Commons code-base that prevent them from functioning on AEM as a Cloud Service (these features will continue to function on the supported AEM 6.x installs).

As new features are found to be incompatible with AEM as a Cloud Service, they will be added to this list, and disabled via the kill-switch in ACS AEM Commons code base.

| [OnDeploy Scripts](/acs-aem-commons/features/on-deploy-scripts/index.md) | INCOMPATIBLE (ANTI-PATTERN) | OnDeploy Scripts runs its scripts very early in the deploy lifecycle (approximately when the OSGi bundle starts). In AEM as a Cloud Service, this is still in the Deploy phase, and long running scripts running at this time can result failed deployments, or mis-reported failed deployments. Instead use repoinit or Sling Pipes (triggering the Sling Pipe after the Deployment is complete and the new code base is fully active) |
| [Syslog Appender](/acs-aem-commons/features/syslog-appender/index.html) | REPLACED/INCOMPATIBLE | AEM CS can stream logs to customer's Splunk. AEM CS does not support emitting logs over syslog as UDP or TCP. |
| [Version Clientlibs](/acs-aem-commons/features/versioned-clientlibs/index.html) | REPLACED | This has been superseded with superior OOTB AEM as a Cloud Service functionality. |
