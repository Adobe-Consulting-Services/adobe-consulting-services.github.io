AEM Chrome Plug-in is a open-source, must-have AEM developer extension for the Google Chrome browser.

AEM Chrome Plug-in has two main sets of functionality, each of which can be use independently of the other. The functionality is separated into 2 top-level tabs in the plug-in.

* **Log Tracer**: Which collects and displays request-based log data right in the browser.
