## Purpose

Page Compare is a tool for comparing two different pages or page versions side-by-side. It's similar to the ACS AEM Commons [Version Compare](/acs-aem-commons/features/version-compare/index.html) tool from which it is originated.

Motivations for creating this tool was:

* Version Compare with huge pages and many versions is difficult
* Loading time and html markup increases and handling in the browser is getting difficult
* The ability to compare two different pages (Multi-site manager)
