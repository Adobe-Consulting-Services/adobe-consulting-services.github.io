These features, while include in ACS AEM Commons, are deprecated as they have been superseded with other better functionality, or they build on deprecated technology that should be avoided in this modern age of AEM.

We recommend avoiding these features as they:

* encourage use of deprecated approaches
* will not enjoy the support and attention for fixes by the core ACS AEM Commons team
* will eventually be removed entirely


<div style="background-color: #444; font-size: 2rem; color: white; padding: 2rem 4rem; text-align: center; border-radius: 5px;">
    All deprecated features listed on this page have been removed in ACS AEM Commons 6.
