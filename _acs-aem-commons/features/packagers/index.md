### Using Packagers on AEM Publish

Because the ACS Commons Packagers are built using the ClassicUI dialogs, the configuration dialogs are automatically force-disabled on AEM Publish.

In order to use Packages on AEM Publish, you must define the Package configuration on AEM Author, replicate the Packager page to AEM publish, and then Create the package on AEM Publish based on that replicated configuration.
