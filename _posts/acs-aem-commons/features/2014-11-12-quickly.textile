h2. Beta

Quickly is in Beta. 

Full cross-browser support is not yet available. Quickly's browser support is limited to a subset of AngularJS 1.3's native browser support.

Quickly injects itself into pages immediately before the closing body tag. Please report any conflicts between Quickly and AEM (or your application) to the "ACS AEM Commons GitHub Issues site":https://github.com/Adobe-Consulting-Services/acs-aem-commons/issues

h2. Purpose

Quickly's goal is to speed up navigation throughout AEM using a Searchlight/Alfread style HUD console that facilitates navigating AEM from the keyboard.

h2. How to Use

* Remember that Quickly is in Beta!

* Define a @sling:OsgiConfig@ to enable the Quickly engine for AEM Authors Only

@/apps/mysite/config.author/com.adobe.acs.commons.quickly.impl.QuicklyEngineImpl.xml@

{% highlight xml %}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<jcr:root xmlns:sling="http://sling.apache.org/jcr/sling/1.0" xmlns:cq="http://www.day.com/jcr/cq/1.0" xmlns:jcr="http://www.jcp.org/jcr/1.0" xmlns:nt="http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0"
    jcr:primaryType="sling:OsgiConfig"
    results.mode="[dev]"/>
{% endhighlight %}

* Set `results.mode` to blank for authoring oriented results
* Set `results.mode` to `dev` for developer oriented results in the console (like CRXDE Lite). This includes all the "authoring" Web UIs.


Or you can set it directly on your local via the "Adobe Web Console":http://localhost:4502/system/console/configMgr
